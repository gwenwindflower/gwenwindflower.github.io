## Are you actually measuring data quality?

We know the map is not the territory. Data is a woven net thrown over the world, capturing it in a grid of variable resolution. The fineness, or grain, of this grid forms the resolution of our map.

Typically, we then proceed to measure things like the internal consistency of our map, the resolution, and how quickly it updates to changes in the terrain. Two related maps stay internally consistent? Quality. Map updates in near-realtime? High quality. Super high resolution of granular details? The most quality. We often assume that making these measures higher is an unalloyed good.

There's a problem with these self-referential, tautological measures though: none of them tells if a map is _fulfilling its purpose_. 

**Maps should be measured on how well they get you where you want to go.** To do that maps need to be as detailed and accurate as necessary and *no more*.

## A trip to the library
Imagine you need to drive from your home to the library. You pull up a map that not only shows roads, but every plant, person, animal, and vehicle in realtime. These features would actively obscure your ability to plan your route. You just need to see the roads, and ideally some traffic information.

To know the proper level of _detail, pace, and presence_ for your map you need to know what you want to do.

This is _intentionality_, the missing ingredient I see lacking most often in my work as an analytics engineer.

Very often, this is because intentions around the maps themselves obfuscate that the larger, more necessary intention is missing. For example, we may think "I want to understand my orders and revenue", is our intention. This is directed at the map though! We need to know the _purpose_ of the map. "I want to increase revenue by 10% over the next year" -- *that's* an intention that can inform our map-making.

Knowing that is like knowing we want to take our car to the library. It informs a host of decisions we need to make about detail, pace, and presence. Knowing the intentions and action we're taking to get where we're going will tell us what resolution is ideal, how often our data needs to be refreshed, and what features are important to include.

## Intention is the canvas for impact
Defining the parameters of our map will also save us needless time and expense, but most importantly, it allow us to _actually measure the quality of our map_. 

There's nothing wrong with current conventional data quality measures, but they should be secondary to actually measuring the _impact_ and _effectiveness_ of our data, and to do that we need *intention*. There is constant discussion of how hard it is to measure the impact of data teams, and that's directly because of a lack of intentionality with our data. The more we can stake out our desired destinations when building our maps, the better we can measure how well they got us where we wanted to go.

The next time you're getting ready to build a model, create a dashboard, or ingest a new data source, make sure you know what your intention is. Where do you want to go and how fast? What metrics do you want to move, by how much, and by when?

Start bringing intentionality into your work, and watch your ability to measure your impact, partner with stakeholders, and prioritize your days flourish.
