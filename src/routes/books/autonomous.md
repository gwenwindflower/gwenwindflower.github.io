There are multiple vectors to appreciate a book along: new ideas, poetically evocative language, interesting plot, emotional response, investment in characters. "Autonomous" for me, of all the sci-fi books I've read in the past 3 years, had the highest score across the most of these vectors. It was a blast to read, I was deeply invested in all of the characters, it had strokes of gorgeous language, and tons of fresh ideas. As a debut novel, it's quite stunning, and I'm very excited to read  Annalee's next book "The Terraformers".
