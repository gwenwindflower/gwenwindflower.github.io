An incredible novel within a novel (within a novel...within a novel), The Blind Assassin seems to be the work that cemented Atwood as not just the incredible feminist speculative fiction writer of "The Handmaid's Tale", but a flexible and preternaturally gifted writer of any style she brings her hand to.

I read half this book by the light of the bathroom at night in my room at a mental hospital, with unbreakable insomnia after a suicide attempt. This was very appropriate timing. Unfortunately because of the trauma now associated with it I'm struggling to motivate to return to it and finish it.

I was stunned and delighted by Atwood's poetic mastery of language though, it's really something to behold.
