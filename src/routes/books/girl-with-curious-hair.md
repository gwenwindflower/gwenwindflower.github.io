This is the only DFW I've read. I think he's impressively full of ideas that stick, and his ability to mimic and shift styles in a peak postmodern way is undeniably skillful. Did I love reading these stories? I did not. Do I, unlike many short story collections, remember many of them with great clarity? Yes, yes I do. Is my primary issue with Mr. Foster Wallace the bandana? Probably.
